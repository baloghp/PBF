# Evaluation Framework

This framework reflects cross‑corporate project business realities per the Project Business Compendium. It explicitly evaluates commercial/legal strength, liquidity and solvency exposure across parties, governance at the customer–contractor interface, and business acumen in delivery, in addition to technical fitness and benefits.

## Scoring Scale (0–5)
- 0: Not demonstrated / missing evidence
- 1: Poor – significant gaps; below industry baseline
- 2: Fair – basic practice; inconsistent outcomes
- 3: Good – solid, consistent practice; meets expectations
- 4: Very Good – strong performance; exceeds benchmarks
- 5: Excellent – exemplary, industry‑leading impact

## Criteria and Weights (100%)
- Project success (outcomes) – 15%
  - Delivery performance vs. baseline (scope, time, cost, quality), benefits realization, and handover effectiveness.
- Customer satisfaction – 10%
  - Satisfaction/NPS, stakeholder feedback, dispute avoidance/resolution quality, and relationship stewardship post‑project.
- Agility & adaptability – 8%
  - Responsiveness to change; effective change control/requirements management under the chosen contracting model.
- Commercial model (liquidity impact) – 15%
  - Price realism; milestone cash‑flow; advances/retentions; effect on both parties’ liquidity and solvency during execution.
- Legal soundness – 12%
  - Applicable law, jurisdiction, warranty/liability limits, privity, completeness; suitability of contracting approach to collaboration model.
- Interface and governance – 12%
  - Clarity of obligations at the customer–contractor boundary (customer provisions/enabling services vs contractor deliverables/timelines); escalation paths; decision rights; cross‑corporate governance structures.
- Risk management (cross‑corporate) – 8%
  - Identification of cross‑party risks (bankruptcy propagation, subcontractor dependencies, IP/data, export/GDPR); mitigations and contingency.
- Team and business acumen – 8%
  - Leadership and interpersonal effectiveness across organizations; ability to balance customer satisfaction with profitability and liquidity (profit‑center management by contractor PMs).
- Integrity and conduct – 6%
  - Adherence to an explicit cross‑corporate code of conduct; anti‑corruption stance; transparency and documentation discipline.
- Strategic fit and benefits – 6%
  - Business outcomes and portfolio alignment; recognizes that for contractors projects are the business and for customers they are revenue/risk drivers.

## Cross‑Corporate Anchors (what to look for)
- Explicit distinction of internal vs customer projects; treatment of multi‑party interfaces where projects break through organizational walls.
- Suitability for mixed internal/external delivery models (extended workbench vs fully outsourced); impact on PM responsibilities and risk profiles.
- Contract completeness and enforceability: coverage of law/jurisdiction, warranty/liability, capacity and signatures, notice provisions, change control, dispute resolution.
- Contractor financial resilience: liquidity and cash‑flow profile; insolvency risk and buffers; sensitivity of the payment schedule to cost burn.

## Evidence Requirements (Practical Artifacts)
- Draft contract matrix mapping obligations, applicable law, jurisdiction, warranties/liability, notice and change mechanisms.
- Customer–contractor interface RACI including provisions and enabling services, for inclusion in charter/contract attachments.
- Payment schedule vs cost‑burn cash‑flow curve demonstrating liquidity adequacy through milestones, advances, and retentions.
- Code of conduct acknowledgment and integrity plan aligned to the cross‑corporate template.

## Performance Descriptors (examples)
- Delivery: variance vs baseline (SPI/CPI, milestone adherence, scope control); schedule and cost realism.
- Commercial model: milestone plan supports liquidity of both parties; clear retention/advance logic; fair risk‑sharing.
- Legal: contract is complete and enforceable; terms match collaboration model; clear privity and subcontract flow‑downs.
- Interface/governance: crisp allocation of obligations; timely escalation; clear decision rights and PBMO/PMO roles.
- Risk: cross‑corporate risk register with owner per risk and mitigations; insolvency cascade addressed.
- Integrity: COI controls; transparency; documentation discipline in line with contract performance guidance.
- Team/acumen: evidence of profit‑center management, claim prevention, and win‑win negotiation behavior.

## Normalization & Aggregation
- Each criterion scored 0–5; weights applied on a 0–100 scale.
- Minimum two independent juror scores per nomination; moderated average for final.
- Track inter‑rater reliability; investigate when < 0.7 (Spearman or ICC).
