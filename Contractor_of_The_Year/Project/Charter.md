# PBF Contractor of the Year – Project Charter

## Purpose
Establish a credible, transparent annual awards program that positions the Project Business Foundation (PBF) as the global authority in Project Business Management and recognizes excellence in cross-corporate project delivery.

## Objectives (Year 1)
- Launch one full award cycle across five industry categories.
- Achieve minimum 100 qualified nominations across regions.
- Establish independent jury governance with conflict-of-interest controls.
- Publish transparent evaluation framework and results summary.

## Scope
- In scope: program governance, jury recruitment and training, nomination platform, evaluation process, communications and ceremony.
- Out of scope: commercial sponsorship sales (pilot year), regional sub-awards, physical gala event.

## Success Metrics
- Participation: 100+ qualified nominations, 3+ regions.
- Quality: inter-rater reliability ≥ 0.7; zero unresolved COI incidents.
- Impact: media/social reach targets; stakeholder satisfaction ≥ 4.2/5.

## Governance
- Executive Sponsor: PBF Executive Board
- Steering Committee: Program Lead, Legal/Compliance, Communications, Technology
- Program Lead (PM): Responsible for end-to-end delivery
- Advisory: External subject-matter experts as needed

## Roles & Responsibilities (RACI high-level)
- Program Lead: R/A for delivery, budget, schedule
- Legal: A for policies, COI, data protection, T&Cs
- Tech Lead: R for platform build/ops, security, analytics
- Comms Lead: R for brand, press, website, social, ceremony
- Category Chairs: R for jury recruitment, moderation, consensus

## Timeline
Standard 16-week implementation cycle; see `16-Week-Implementation-Plan.md`.

### Annual Cycle (Pilot Year)
- Awards Year: 2025
- Eligibility Cutoff: projects must have reached the beginning of the closing phase by 31 Dec 2025 (for the 2025 awards).
- Evaluation Window: Nov 2025 – Jan 2026 (individual scoring and consensus).
- Winners Announcement: Feb 2026.

Notes:
- Communications, platform configuration, and jury onboarding follow the 16-week cadence leading into the above dates.
- Future years follow the same pattern: eligibility cutoff at calendar year-end; winners announced the following February.

## Budget (pilot, order-of-magnitude)
- Platform (build/license): EUR 10–25k
- Comms & creative: EUR 8–20k
- Program ops (PM/admin/tools): EUR 25–40k
- Ceremony (virtual production): EUR 5–15k

## Constraints & Assumptions
- Lean internal team; leverage standard operating procedures and templates.
- Cloud-first platform; GDPR-compliant data handling.
- Independent jury, no PBF staff as scorers.

## Risks (top)
- Low nomination volume → early outreach and partner seeding
- COI or bias → strict policies, declarations, anonymous scoring
- Platform delays → buy vs build decision by Week 2

## Approvals
- Charter approval by Executive Sponsor and Steering Committee.
